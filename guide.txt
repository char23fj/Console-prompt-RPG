Any move you make causes a "threat" counter to approach 0.  When it hits 1,
a robot appears, and when it hits 0, the robot attacks you.  Various actions
and items will bump up this threat counter and hold off attacks.

First, search the front hall.  It will reveal a means to bar the door, which
increases the threat countdown.  Bar the door, then go west to the work area.

In the work area, search and then use the computer.  After doing this, pick up
both items on the ground.  They can be used as weapons, giving you a total of
three uses.  Go north to the supply room.

In the supply room, search and then pick up the power cell.  It can be used
in the prototype chamber.  Go east.

Now you're in the office; go straight through (east) for now.

In the proto chamber, search and it will reveal a robot.  Use the power cell.
It will power up the robot, and it will protect you (alleviates some threat,
but does not last long).  Go back to the office.

Now search the office.  There is a keycard, so pick that up.  Then unlock
the deadbolt.  Now you can go south to the front hall.

You're back in the front hall.  Use the key card.  Then go east.

In the terminal room, search the area and then use the main computer.
Select the option to initiate the Omega Protocol.

This will display a dialog.  Press enter to continue it.


----=====SPOILER ALERT=====----

The computer betrays you and you
don't truly "win" the game.
