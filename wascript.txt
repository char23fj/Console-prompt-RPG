This is a mechanical work area.  Some tools are lying about;
something on one of these tables might be useful.

Two doors in this room - the east door you just came through,
and the north door, which leads to a supply room.  This one
is unlocked.

But there is a computer here which might have something else
for you.  You recall a program you designed for when your
robots were acting up.  It freezes a bot's opertions by
inserting a code snippet with an infinite loop into its
operating system.  Could be worth a look.
