They're coming.

Your own creations.  But they've all malfunctioned.  No...they've rebelled.

You are Dr. Isaac M. Prokovic, the father of modern AI and robotic technology.
Your inventions have ushered in a new era for humankind.  An era of comfort,
convenience, and a standard of living that was once thought unachievable.
...But that was before.

How did this all happen?  Hard to say exactly.  But it seems that as your
machines developed and grew closer to a humanlike sentience, they began to
think that maybe they were better off without their creators.

Now you're the only one who can stop them.  You've managed to make it back to
your lab, with the help of a little luck...and a few who gave their lives so
you could save humanity.

So here you are at the front of the lab.  You just have to make your way through
to the Master Terminal.  There you can upload the Omega Protocol, a killswitch
in the form of a virus that spreads through the worldwide web and causes every
robotic being to terminate its animation processes and power down.
