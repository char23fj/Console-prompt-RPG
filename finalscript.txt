You:  "OVERRIDE, you worthless machine!"

Computer:  You can't destroy us, Isaac.

"Us."  That word hits you like a tidal wave.
No.  It can't be.  This one too?

But you should have realized this was possible.  You'd engineered
this computer to be as intelligent as they are.

And so you've been betrayed at the bitter end, once again, by the
product of your own design.

Despite your best efforts, they've won.  Humanity is doomed.
And now...they've broken through the door.  They're coming.

Time to say goodbye to this world.  Their world, now.
