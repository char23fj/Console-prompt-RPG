In this first room are four doors.  The south door leads out.  Don't go that way.
The east door will take you to the Master Terminal.  It has a keycard lock.
The north door leads to an office area, but it's deadbolted from the other side.
The mechanical work area lies beyond the west door.

There is a small switchboard that triggers the security system, barring the
front door.  It could hold your attackers out for a bit.
